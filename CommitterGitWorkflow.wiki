#Workflow for selenium committers

= Introduction =

This page describes a standard committer workflow when fetching stuff from github into google code. It does not describe a "standard" commit/push cycle since that has been documented about 10000 other places.

= Handling a pull request =

{{{
git pull --no-ff https://github.com/<username>/selenium master
}}}

The exact url will be noted in the pull request mail from github. Please note the branch name "master" may be different.

This pull mechanism will create one commit for the actual submission and a merge on top of that, which will identify the person who accepted the pull request

= Rebasing =

We prefer that you rebase and squash whatever it is you are submitting to the project, so that each commit constists of a logical change that compiles and tests well.

When accepting other people's changes, do *not* rebase their submission unless you have an explicit agreement with the submitter that this is ok. If the submitter is you, well consult yourself.

The reason for this is that we can make no assumptions about the submitter's ability to grasp being rebased on, which requires some special handling.
