#summary What's left to do before we ship 3.0

= User Visible Changes = 

== Migrate all drivers to use the status strings rather than status codes in responses ==

== Update client bindings to also cope with that ==

== Write a new runner for the html-suite tests ==

== Segment the build to remove RC ==

= Clean up =

== Using WebDriver after quit() should be an IllegalStateException ==

Multiple calls to WebDriver.quit() should still be safe.

== Clean up WebDriver constructors, pulling heavy initialization logic into a Builder class ==

== Migrate to Netty or webbit server ==

== Delete unnecessary cruft ==
 
== Land a cleaner end point for the rc emulation ==
